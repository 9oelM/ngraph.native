# ngraph.native
C++ implementation of force-based layout from ngraph. This is equivalent to [ngraph.offline.layout](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.offline.layout). Unfortunately I don't have bindings to nodejs (yet).

If you want to use it, here is a demo how I used it: https://gist.github.com/anvaka/60134e24bf8c5cdb9574 

My C++ is very much rusty, please feel free to contribute if you find something to improve.
